// Adapter is a minimal, local interface for resolving agent-specific paths.
// It is a structural subset of agents.Adapter (from internal/agents), covering
// only the methods needed by the verify health-check builders.
//
// By defining this interface locally, internal/verify avoids importing
// internal/agents and therefore avoids any import cycle. Concrete adapters
// (e.g. *claude.Adapter, *opencode.Adapter) satisfy this interface by
// structural typing without modification.
