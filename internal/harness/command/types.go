// Package command implements installation of slash-command harnesses — embedded
// .md files written into each focused agent's slash-command directory.
//
// This package mirrors internal/harness/skill in structure (embed → idempotent
// write → backup) but for slash-command files rather than SKILL.md directories.
// Added in C-31.
